    <h1>Viphu Nguyen Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>
    <h2>First, the basics.</h2>

    <p>You need the following to build your website.</p>
    <p>Below </p>
    <ul> <!-- To create an unordered list that shows we need to build a website-->
        <li>HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Node.js</li>
        <li>And other web development frameworks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should list your top 5 favourite albums below.</p>
    <ol> <!-- To create an ordered list that shows the top favourite albums-->
        <li>Lilac By IU</li>
        <li>Patlette By IU</li>
        <li>Pieces By IU</li>
        <li>Querencia by Chung Ha</li>
        <li>One of a Kind By G Dragon</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
    <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</p><br>
    <p>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p><br>
    <p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p><br>

    <hr/> <!-- To create a hard rule-->

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
    <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

    <!-- Uploads of four png images-->
    <img src='images/onigiri_1.png'/>
    <img src='images/onigiri_2.png'/>
    <img src='images/onigiri_3.png'/>
    <img src='images/onigiri_4.png'/>

    <hr/> <!-- To create a soft line break-->

    <p><a href="https://github.com/ViphuKN/INST377-Lab-Work">Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.</a></p> <!-- Include a hyperlink to my Github repository-->
    <p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
