    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
    <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.</p>
    <p>Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>
    <p>Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.</p>
