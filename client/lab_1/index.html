    <h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both.</strong></em></p>

    <h3>Empty Elements</h3>
    <p> Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br>
        Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
        Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.<br></p>

    <hr/> <!-- To create a hard rule-->

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>Include the four images in the /images folder below</p>
    <p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

    <!-- Uploads of four png images-->
    <img src='images/mochi.jpg'/>
    <img src='images/mochi.png'/>
    <img src='images/mochi.svg'/>
    <img src='images/mochi.gif'/>

    <hr/> <!-- To create a hard rule-->

    <p><a href="https://github.com/ViphuKN/INST377-Lab-Work">Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.</a></p> <!-- Include a hyperlink to my Github repository-->
    <p>If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
