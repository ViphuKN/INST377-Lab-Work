CSS Selectors

<a class = 'nav' href="selectors.html">Selectors</a> <!--Creating a Nav Bar with a link to selectors.html-->
<a class = 'nav' href="index.html">Main Page</a> <!--Creating a Nav Bar with a link to index.html-->

CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.
Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages.
